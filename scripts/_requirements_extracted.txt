Final project 
 Course: Advanced Databases (NoSQL) 
1. General Description: 
The final project is a mandatory summative assessment for the course Advanced Databases (NoSQL).  
 
2. Project Format 
 Project type: Web application only (telegram bots, mobile/desktop application, games, backend 
only are not allowed) 
 Team size: 1-2 students 
 Implementation: Backend + Frontend (both required) 
 Databases: MongoDB (NoSQL) 
 Defense: Mandatory 
 Maximum score: 100 points  
 
3. Project Objective 
The objective of this project is to evaluate students’ ability to: 
 design advanced NoSQL data models 
 implement MongoDB queries and aggregations 
 develop backend logic around MongoDB 
 document database structures, APIs, and design decisions 
 
4. Project Requirements 
The backend must be: 
 Expose a RESTful API, 
 Use MongoDB as the primary database, 
 Implement meaningful business logic. 
 
Minimum API Requirements: 
 1 student: at least 8 REST API endpoints 
 2 students: at least 12 REST API endpoints 
 
Endpoints must include: 
 Full CRUD functionality, 
 At least one aggregation-based endpoint, 
 Advanced update and delete operations. 
 
The Database Requirements: 
 CRUD operations across multiple collections, 
 Embedded and referenced data models, 
 Advanced update/delete operators, 
 Multi-stage aggregation pipelines, 
 Compound indexes and query optimization, 
 Authentication and authorization. 
 
The frontend must be: 
 provide basic interaction with the backend, 
 allow users to create, view, update, and delete data. 
 
Minimum pages: 
 1 student: at least 4 pages 
 2 students: at least 6 pages. 


===== PAGE 2 =====
Document Requirements must include detailed README and report: 
 Cover page including name, group, topic, department. 
 At least 10 pages 
 Project Overview 
 System architecture 
 Database schema description 
 MongoDB queries 
 API documentation 
 Indexing and optimization strategy 
 Contribution of each student 
 
Project Defense: 
 Format: live demo, report, code 
 Duration: 15-20 minutes per team 
 Any team member will be asked questions about any part of the project. 
 Absence or refusal to defend will be graded as 0 points. 
 
Submission: 
 Report 
 GitHub link

Additional architectural or engineering solutions may be rewarded with bonus points, provided the 
core MongoDB and backend requirements are fully satisfied. The list below contains examples only 
and is not exhaustive. 
For example: 
 Swagger / OpenAPI Specification 
 ACID Transactions 
 Proper Environment Configuration (.env usage) 
 Centralized Error Handling 
 Pagination, Filtering, Sorting Standards 
 API Versioning
